Wombat256 Colorscheme for Vim

This is a 256 color scheme for console based Vim.
It is based on the original wombat GVIM scheme from Lars H. Nielsen (dengmao@gmail.com)

See https://gergap.wordpress.com/2015/08/19/updated-wombat256-colorscheme/ for
an example screenshot.

It also supports ShowMarks hilight groups.

note on italics: cterm=italic didn't work out of the box in my KDE Konsole.
Exporting TERM=rxvt-unicode-256color in my ~/.bashrc fixed that issue.
